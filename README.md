<h1>About Me</h1>
I am a B.Tech. CSE student at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar. A coder<⁄> by brain, with a spiritual heart💙 and a creative🎨 mind. I love to explore non-fiction and different genres of books📚. I am not the kind of person who’s into partying and all but if you want to have deep conversations on some crazy topics, don’t hesitate to ping📌 me up. Not to forget, hustling with Science and Technology👩‍💻 requires a lot of patience.
